line|block search and replace

search and replace using buffers
select text like work|line(s)|block
and show that text in buffer with same text below
we can edit src text to make groups|regex and so on
and in replaced text we can use those groups
or edit text
then check for results before confirming or doing one by one confirmation
or skipping something or doing multiple replacements at same time using text objects (like in functions)
