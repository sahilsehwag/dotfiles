mode triggers in a new tab
each jump opens a new window stacked below the last window with previous symbol
and previous window becomes `n` lines long and eventually 1 line long
jump history becomes trivial using c-j and c-k
simple since it uses simple/basic vim constructs
jumping/focusing on some window(symbol) focuses it and makes other 1 line long

persistent jump history view(like sessions)
saving this view for future use
project/directory/branch based persistence

preview any history item from jump history to open find the history we want
navigating between various histories like quickfix list history navigation

automatic suggesting/finding/opening of list of histories by current symbol matching/under the cursor

qf list can be used?

abstract/generaize it to jumplist/taglist/insertlist and so on....
