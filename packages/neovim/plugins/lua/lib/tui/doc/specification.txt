elegant restrictive editing like dired/dirbug/spectre to use buffer as an interface for commands for operations using vim mechanics

navigation
	search = /
	tree navigation = hjkl
philosophy:
	* unix->everything is a file
	* vim is a tool for editing files
	* therefore everything is a buffer in vim like operations
2 ways of makeing buffer restrictive
	* selected blocks are editable
	* selected blocks are non-editable
nesting:
	* single
	* tree
	* recursive (just jump to specific item)
history:
	* undo/redo
	* logs
	* jump stack
	* marks
	* bookmarks
	* contextual history (based on project/cwd)
changes(CRUD):
	* non-permanent changes
	* easy revert
	* using git for management??
help:
	* ? on the item for the actions
	* hydra/which-key like menu
completion
	* based on context/line/item
